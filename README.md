Sharing is one of the happiness.
Today is 3/25/2020, I restart this Github, as previously I didn't notice its value and was not able to obtain what I really wanted.
I hope to be an advanced coder, an extraordinary developer, an excellent cs-worker, en, yes, blue ribbon.
I know I have countless drawbacks as well as loopholes, I swear I will try hard.
I put all my trust on you, Eric.
Dream of being admitted by National University of Singapore!
Long to see you!
